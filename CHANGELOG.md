# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project follows the 0.x versioning policy described in the
README's Installation section (every merge to `main` is tagged; minor bumps
are interface changes, patch bumps are everything else).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-19

Hardware verification: not required (dispatch, exports and tests only; no
driver runtime paths changed).

### Changed
- Unified every `gui(device)` method onto a single generic in
  `AbstractInstrument`/`MicroscopeControl` so `gui` dispatches correctly
  instead of colliding across interface and driver modules.
- Resolved 20 other top-level names that two or more submodules exported as
  distinct, colliding bindings (`Dimensions`, `getdatatypes`,
  `getnumchannels`, `getranges`, `getvalue`, `isxmoving`, `isymoving`,
  `movexy`, `reference`, `reset`, `servoxy`, `set_exposuretime`, `set_roi`,
  `set_triggermode`, `setexposuretime`, `setexposuretime!`, `setroi!`,
  `settriggermode`, `setupIO`, `setvalue`) by lifting camera setters
  (`setexposuretime!`, `setroi!`, `settriggermode!`) into `CameraInterface`,
  extending `Base.reset` for `TRIG` devices instead of re-exporting a
  colliding `reset`, dropping dead exports that were never implemented, and
  unexporting device-specific helpers that only ever needed qualified
  access.
- Removed the SmarAct stage's bang-named duplicates
  (`initialize!, shutdown!, move!, move_um!, getposition!, home!,
  stopmotion!`) from its public exports; the StageInterface bridge in
  `stageinterface_bridge_smaract.jl` is the public API.
- Interface fallback stubs in `src/hardware_interfaces/*/interface_functions.jl`
  (and the stage GUI's dimension-dispatch fallback) now `error(...)` instead
  of `@error`-and-return-`nothing`, so an unimplemented method fails loudly.
  A device that has no concrete `initialize`/`shutdown`/`export_state` of its
  own therefore now throws when that method is called, where it previously
  logged and returned `nothing`. Still affected after this PR: `ThorCamCSCCamera`
  (`initialize`, `export_state`); `TCubeLaser` (its own `export_state` takes
  an extra, unused positional argument, so the 1-arg contract call never
  reaches it and falls through to the throwing stub); `MLSLM` (outside the
  `AbstractInstrument` hierarchy and with no lifecycle methods at all) and
  `Triggerscope4` (also outside the hierarchy; it implements `initialize` and
  `shutdown` but has no `export_state`). A downstream loop that calls
  `shutdown` on every device in turn should wrap each call in `try`/`catch`
  until these are fixed, or one throwing device aborts the rest of the loop.
- `NIdaq` gained concrete no-op `initialize`/`shutdown` (DAQmx tasks are
  created and deleted per operation via `createtask`/`deletetask`, so there
  was never a persistent connection to open or close); it no longer throws
  and is no longer one of the devices listed above.

### Removed
- SmarAct MCS2 stage's bang-named low-level methods are no longer exported
  from `MicroscopeControl` (see "Changed" above); qualified access remains,
  and the interface-level replacement differs in units and return value:
  - `initialize!`, `shutdown!`, `home!`, `stopmotion!` -> the interface's
    `initialize`, `shutdown`, `home`, `stopmotion`, or qualified as
    `MicroscopeControl.HardwareImplementations.MCS2Stage_mod.initialize!` etc.
  - `move!(stage, targets_pm::Vector{Int64})` (picometres) -> qualified as
    `MicroscopeControl.HardwareImplementations.MCS2Stage_mod.move!`, or the
    interface's `move(stage, x, y[, z])` in micrometres (`Float64`).
  - `move_um!(stage, targets_um::Vector{Float64})` (micrometres) -> qualified
    the same way, or the interface `move(stage, x, y[, z])`.
  - `getposition!(stage) -> Vector{Int64}` (picometres) -> qualified the same
    way, or the interface `getposition(stage)`, which updates
    `stage.real_x`/`real_y`/`real_z` in place and returns no vector.
- TCube laser's `setupIO` is no longer exported (it collided with OK_XEM's
  unrelated `setupIO`); use
  `MicroscopeControl.HardwareImplementations.TCubeLaserControl.setupIO`.

### Fixed
- `test/contract.jl` (new "Interface Contract" testset) guards against a
  regression of any of the above: no ambiguous top-level exports, every
  concrete device has the core `AbstractInstrument` methods it should, and
  the interface fallbacks actually throw.
- Added a binding-identity guard ("No shadowed generics in submodules") that
  catches a driver defining `gui`/`initialize`/etc. via a bare `using` of its
  interface (rather than an explicit `import` or a fully-qualified method
  definition): the definition silently creates a new, disconnected function
  local to that module instead of extending the real generic, so calls
  through `MicroscopeControl` fall through to an unrelated fallback instead
  of erroring. The guard found and fixed one real case:
  `CameraInterface`'s own `export_state` fallback was such a shadow (now
  imported explicitly in `CameraInterface.jl`). It also found that `pi_stage`
  (PI) intentionally shadows `move`/`getposition`/`getrange`/`stopmotion`/`servo`
  as private ccall helpers behind correctly-qualified public wrappers in
  `interface_methods.jl`; `getrange` was missing its wrapper (a real gap, now
  added) while the other four were already wired correctly, so the guard
  excludes PI's own binding for all five by name rather than "fixing" a
  pattern that isn't broken.
